            <p>Hello! I am Bernard, and this is the first portfolio site I've created! I am an aspiring web developer hoping to learn how to code and make great websites and apps. For now this site will be simple and reflective of my beginner skill level at the beginning of the bootcamp course but as I progress, I hope to come back and improve on it regularly.</p>
            <p>As someone who has used and enjoyed computers and the internet since a young age, I am excited to be able to learn how websites work and to create projects of my own. Creation and tinkering have always been interests in mine, as is apparent in the hobbies I've enjoyed over the years, which include RC cars, building computers, and working on cars. Web development appeals to me in the same sort of way so I cannot wait to create and personalize things on this journey!</p>
